# Explanation of the Code in `src/wordle.ts`

## Imports and Initialization

- The code imports necessary modules: `fs` for file system operations, `path` for handling file paths, and `readline` for reading input from the console.
- It creates a `readline` interface for reading input from the console.
- It initializes an empty array `words` to store the words read from the file.
- It defines a success message `successString` to be displayed when the user guesses the word correctly.

## Main Function

- The `main` function reads the words from the file `resources/words.txt` and stores them in the `words` array.
- It logs the number of words read and a welcome message.

## Input Function

- The `inputWord` function prompts the user for a 5-letter word.
- It repeats the prompt until a valid word (exactly 5 letters and present in the `words` array) is entered.
- It calls the provided callback function with the valid word.

## Generate Answer Function

- The `generateAnswer` function generates feedback for the guessed word.
- Currently, it returns a placeholder string "XXXXX".

## Check Word Function

- The `checkWord` function checks if the guessed word matches the target word.
- If the words match, it returns the success message.
- Otherwise, it calls `generateAnswer` to generate feedback.

## Wordle Game Function

- The `wordle` function selects a random target word from the `words` array.
- It allows the user multiple attempts (10 tries) to guess the word.
- It calls `inputWord` to get the user's guess and checks the guess using `checkWord`.
- If the user guesses the word correctly, it logs a success message and closes the `readline` interface.

## Initialization and Start

- The `main` function is called to initialize the game.
- The `wordle` function is called to start the Wordle game.
